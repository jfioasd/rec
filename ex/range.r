32 47 [b 1:P 1:1:[0:^\1:\1;] b[^]^ 1:/1;]

[ 0^
(P.S. While debugging the program `32 47 [b 1:P 1:1:[0:^\1:\1;] b[^]^ 1:/1;]`,
I found some inconveniences of the debugger, so that's why I added the `c` command.
It turned out to be a bug of the implementation of `^`, which jumps over a character
with the for loop increment.)
